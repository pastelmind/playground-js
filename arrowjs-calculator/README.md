# ArrowJS Calculator

This is a simple calculator built with [ArrowJS](https://github.com/justin-schroeder/arrow-js). It is based on the [Calculator demo app](https://www.arrow-js.com/demos/calculator.html) provided in the [Examples](https://www.arrow-js.com/docs/#examples) section of ArrowJS' home page. I made it to learn how to use ArrowJS.
